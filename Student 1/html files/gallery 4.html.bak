To distinguish them from shorts, trousers may be called long trousers in certain contexts such as school uniform, where tailored shorts may be called short trousers in the UK<p>"

The frock coat in turn became cut away into the modern morning coat, giving us the two modern version of tail coats, but the evolution is blurry. Notwithstanding, it seems as if the frock was gradually supplanted by the frock coat in the early 19th century, whereas the former frock style was relegated to evening wear.<p>"

Some shoes are worn as safety equipment, such as steel-toe boots which are required footwear at industrial worksites.<p>"
